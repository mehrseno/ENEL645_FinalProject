# ENEL 645 Final Project: Analyzing MBTI Using Traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models
## Description
This project aims to predict Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality types by applying natural language processing techniques to textual data from social media posts. It incorporates a mix of machine learning and deep learning models to classify the personality types effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized for this project is hosted on Kaggle. You can access it through the following link: [MBTI Personality Type Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/mbti-type). This dataset is instrumental in our analysis, providing a comprehensive collection of text posts categorized by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality types.

## Notebooks
